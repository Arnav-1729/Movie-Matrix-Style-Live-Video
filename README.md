# Movie-Matrix-Style-Live-Video
Just like in movie matrix the ASCII characters create the image instead pixels.
This Project is converts live video to ASCII characters.
What is happening in this is that instead of pixels i am converting them in to string of ASCII Values.
The pixels colour and brightness is changed to the order of the characters;
Finally to add the matrix feel i have coloured the strings green.


Note:change the zoom to 25% as i made the video bigger inorder to make the resolution better.

This is the still from the video.
